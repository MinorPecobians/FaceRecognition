# Library Assist
Despite the increasing availability of digital books, many still choose to
read physical books, and here comes the concept of borrowing a book from the library. Various
manual tasks such as asking for a desired book to librarian, checking if a book is available, keeping a
record of newly added books and maintaining book copies record, collecting data into excel sheet for
analysis, maintaining issue and return records along with fine calculation are all done by our system
on a single click. The system aims to simplify the tasks and save the time of both the librarian and the
user. For issuing and returning the book our system uses a face recognition model which helps to
identify the registered user. It begins
with a background analysis of this library automation idea, detailed problem statement and objectives.
It contains our proposed solution, its approach, working methodology, and flow of the system. Finally,
the actual implementation is described along with code snippets and screenshots. 


1. The Library Automation System is gaining more importance as the number of its users is increasing. Automation of libraries reduces the duplication of work, saves time, and brings accuracy and speed. It also increases efficiency in library services and boosts the quality of work. One such effective system is the Smart Library Automation System using Face Recognition. The Proposed system uses face recognition for entering and getting the details of an end user. Through this application, the book gets issued to the end-user by identifying the user with the help of face recognition and identifying the book using barcode capture. In our system, we are using dlib face recognition, which is 99.38% accurate. We have provided the validations on the user registration form so that we get the right information. The registration process captures the face of the user and book issue, and the book return process checks the details of the user. 

2. End-users of the application will be librarians, students, and teachers. 

3. Our project aims at making the tasks of the library easy and to make the book issuing and returning process more interactive and effortless for the user. Also, our system is responsible for preserving the details of book issue and return and paperless report generation.
