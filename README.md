# FaceRecognition
Despite the increasing availability of digital books, many still choose to
read physical books, and here comes the concept of borrowing a book from the library. Various
manual tasks such as asking for a desired book to librarian, checking if a book is available, keeping a
record of newly added books and maintaining book copies record, collecting data into excel sheet for
analysis, maintaining issue and return records along with fine calculation are all done by our system
on a single click. The system aims to simplify the tasks and save the time of both the librarian and the
user. For issuing and returning the book our system uses a face recognition model which helps to
identify the registered user. It begins
with a background analysis of this library automation idea, detailed problem statement and objectives.
It contains our proposed solution, its approach, working methodology, and flow of the system. Finally,
the actual implementation is described along with code snippets and screenshots.
